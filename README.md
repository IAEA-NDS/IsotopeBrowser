## About

Provided by the Nuclear Data Section of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the app gives properties of more than 4 000 nuclides and isomers.

A Chart of Nuclides, with zooming and tapping enabled, and a Periodic Table of Elements are included to allow easy selection and navigation.

Filter criteria on half-life, decay mode, radiation type and energy can be selected. 
Summary data are presented in a scrolling list, with a details page for each nuclide containing web links to the data sources and further information.
The filtered nuclides can be visualised on the Chart of Nuclides. 

Data are taken from the most recent and reliable sources, and optimal search-and-retrieve performance is achieved with an embedded database, meaning that no network connection is required.
